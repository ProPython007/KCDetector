KCDetector is a portable, low-cost device for detecting creatinine levels using a paper strip and Android app. Users capture an image of the strip, and the app estimates creatinine concentration through image analysis. Designed for resource-limited settings, KCDetector enhances healthcare accessibility by providing an affordable, easy-to-use diagnostic tool for early kidney disease detection.
